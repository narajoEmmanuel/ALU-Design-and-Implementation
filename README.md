### Project Overview
The ALU is a vital component of the central processing unit, responsible for executing logical and arithmetic operations to fulfill instructions within a computer system. 

This laboratory project proposes the design of an ALU that performs seven operations, presenting the results after execution. The solution relies on combinational logic, utilizing a modular design approach. 

#### (ALU) capable of performing the following operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Bitwise AND
4. Bitwise OR
5. Bitwise XOR
6. Bitwise NOT (Unary)
7. Shift Left (Logical)

### Conclusions
- The proposed design correctly performs all implemented logical and arithmetic operations.
- The design achieved low power consumption (5.576W) for the BASYS 3 Artix-7 FPGA.
- The design demonstrated low memory consumption (0.33% of LUT) for the BASYS 3 Artix-7 FPGA.
- The expected behavior was observed during the implementation on the BASYS 3 Artix-7 FPGA, confirming the correctness of the implemented logical and arithmetic operations.
